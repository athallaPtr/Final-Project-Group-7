concept: A simple application that can help people in their daily lives.

**HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS**

**The program allows the user to:**
Add a trip, 
View all recorded trips, 
See a summary of all trips, 
Export the trip report to a text file, and 
Exit the program.

**When the user chooses Add Trip, the program will ask:**
Destination, 
Distance (in km), and 
Transportation category: (bus, train , bicycle, walking).

**Depending on the option:**
*Public transportation* requires the user to enter ticket cost, and 
*Bicycle or walking* requires calories burned

**After that**, the program calculates estimated CO₂ saved, showing the environmental benefit of using sustainable transportation instead of a private car.
